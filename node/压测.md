[node.js服务的压测](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/simple-profiling/)

> There are many third party tools available for profiling Node.js applications but, in many cases, the easiest option is to use the Node.js built in profiler. 

### 以--prof运行服务
> Now assume that we've deployed our application and users are complaining about high latency on requests. We can easily run the app with the built in profiler:

`NODE_ENV=production node --prof app.js`

### 用ab添加测试负载

and put some load on the server using ab (ApacheBench):

```
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/newUser?username=matt&password=password"
ab -k -c 20 -n 250 "http://localhost:8080/auth?username=matt&password=password"
```

and get an ab output of:

```
Concurrency Level:      20
Time taken for tests:   46.932 seconds
Complete requests:      250
Failed requests:        0
Keep-Alive requests:    250
Total transferred:      50250 bytes
HTML transferred:       500 bytes
Requests per second:    5.33 [#/sec] (mean)
Time per request:       3754.556 [ms] (mean)
Time per request:       187.728 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)
Transfer rate:          1.05 [Kbytes/sec] received

...

Percentage of the requests served within a certain time (ms)
  50%   3755
  66%   3804
  75%   3818
  80%   3825
  90%   3845
  95%   3858
  98%   3874
  99%   3875
 100%   4225 (longest request)
 ```

From this output, we see that we're only managing to serve about 5 requests per second and that the average request takes just under 4 seconds round trip.

### 查看--prof生成的压测记录

> Since we ran our application using the --prof option, a tick file was generated in the same directory as your local run of the application. It should have the form isolate-0xnnnnnnnnnnnn-v8.log (where n is a digit).

In order to make sense of this file, we need to use the tick processor bundled with the Node.js binary. To run the processor, use the --prof-process flag:

`node --prof-process isolate-0xnnnnnnnnnnnn-v8.log > processed.txt`


### 分析压测记录文件

> Opening processed.txt in your favorite text editor will give you a few different types of information. The file is broken up into sections which are again broken up by language. First, we look at the summary section and see:

```
 [Summary]:
   ticks  total  nonlib   name
     79    0.2%    0.2%  JavaScript
  36703   97.2%   99.2%  C++
      7    0.0%    0.0%  GC
    767    2.0%          Shared libraries
    215    0.6%          Unaccounted
```
