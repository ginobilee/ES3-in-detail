constructor 与 非 constructor 函数有什么区别呢？
执行 new fn() 时，解析 fn 表达式 -> 得到对应的 Reference -> 对其应用 getValue -> 如果结果的类型不是 Object，则抛类型异常 -> 如果结果没有实现[[Construct]]内部方法，则抛类型异常 -> 用参数去执行该方法

> Each constructor is a function that has a property named ―prototype‖ that is used to implement prototype-based inheritance and shared properties.

普通函数应该也是有 prototypr 的吧？(肯定都有__proto__)

> In a class-based object-oriented language, in general, state is carried by instances, methods are carried by classes, and inheritance is only of structure and behaviour. In ECMAScript, the state and methods are carried by objects, and structure, behaviour, and state are all inherited.

> A primitive value is a datum that is represented directly at the lowest level of the language implementation.

换言之，非基本类型并不是以 ecmascript 底层的表达提供给开发者的。事实上，诸如 object 可以理解为只是规范提供给开发者的 api。通过规范规定的语法(例如dot操作符或[]操作符获得其属性对应的值)，我们可以获取或者设置其中的值。

内建对象(built-in object) 与 原生对象(native-object) 之间有哪些区别？
> [native object] object in an ECMAScript implementation whose semantics are fully defined by this specification rather than by the host environment
> [built-in object] object supplied by an ECMAScript implementation, independent of the host environment, that is present at the start of the execution of an ECMAScript program
> Standard native objects are defined in this specification. **Some native objects are built-in;** others may be constructed **during the course of execution of an ECMAScript program**.
> Standard built-in objects are defined in this specification, and an ECMAScript implementation may specify and define others. **Every built-in object is a native object**. A built-in constructor is a built-in object that is also a constructor.
内建 是 原生 的子集。都是 **规范的实现**(而不是规范) 提供的。内建是在程序开始执行时就已经存在了的(可使用)，而原生还包括在程序执行中创建的一些对象。


> Named accessor properties are inherited for both get access and put access.

> Only callable objects that are host objects may return Reference values.

对于函数声明:
> Pass in the **VariableEnvironment** of the running execution context as the Scope. 
对于函数表达式: 
> Pass in the **LexicalEnvironment** of the running execution context as the Scope. 
那么 VariableEnvironment 和 LexicalEnvironment 有什么区别呢？是不是因为函数声明有 声明提升的关系，VariableEnvironment是执行环境最开始的 环境变量集，而 执行环境到了函数表达式时的 环境变量集？


## Object Environment Records
> Property names that are not an IdentifierName are not included in the set of bound identifiers.

## Execution Contexts
> A new execution context is created whenever control is transferred from the executable code associated with the currently running execution context to executable code that is not associated with that execution context. The newly created execution context is pushed onto the stack and becomes the running execution context.
