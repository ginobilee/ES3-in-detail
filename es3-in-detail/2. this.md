# es中的this

1. 嵌套的执行环境会形成一个栈结构，那么栈顶端的执行环境可以访问到底层的执行环境么？以前我认为在查找变量时会在执行环境栈中依次查找，看了es关于词法环境和作用域链的解析后，知道其实是依着作用域链的层次查找。那么执行环境之间还有什么关联么？
2. this呢，跟执行环境有关么？应该无关。执行环境只是为了确定函数的调用流程。
   1. this的值跟执行环境有关。但函数中this.x形式的求值，只会在this对象上找，找不到就返回undefined，不会再去其他地方(作用域链或者执行环境栈)去找。
   2. 跟执行环境栈无关。
   3. es6中箭头函数的this跟作用链有关。
3. =操作符的执行顺序？



#### 定义

> `this` is a property of the *execution context*. It’s a special object in which context a code is executed.

> `this` is directly related to the [type of executable code](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/chapter-1-execution-contexts/#types-of-executable-code) of the context. The value is determined *on entering the context* and is *immutable* while the code is running in the context.



#### 全局环境下的this

> In the global code, `this` value is *always* the *global object* itself. 



#### 函数环境下的this

1. 第一个特点，this不会绑定上function上，在进入该函数的执行环境时才能确定，因此在不同执行环境下会不同。但在执行过程中不能被改变(与之相对，python中就可以随时改变)。

> The first (and, probably, the main) feature of `this` value in this type of code is that here it is *not statically bound* to a function.
>
> As it has been mentioned above, `this` value is determined on entering the context, and in case with a function code the value can be *absolutely different every time*.
>
> However, at runtime of the code `this` value is *immutable*, i.e. it is not possible to assign a new value to it since *this is not a variable* (in contrast, say, with *Python*programming language and its explicitly defined `self` object which can repeatedly be changed at runtime):

2. 一般来讲，函数的this由调用它的形式决定。

即由 调用函数时的环境+调用函数时的方式(是不是某个对象的方式) 决定。

> **The value of `this` in a function context is provided *by the caller and determined by the current form of a call expression* (how the function call is written syntactically).**

>  in a usual function call, `this` is provided *by the caller* which activates the code of the context, i.e. *the parent context which calls the function*. 

this的值与内部类型`Reference`类有关。

3. `Reference`类

用伪代码来呈现，可以将`Reference`类表示为有`base`和`propertyName`属性的对象:

> Using pseudo-code the value of `Reference` type can be represented as an object with two properties: *base* (i.e. object to which a property belongs) and a *propertyName* in this base.
>
> ```javascript
> var valueOfReferenceType = {
>   base: <base object>,
>   propertyName: <property name>
> };
> ```
>
> > Note: since ES5 a reference also contains property named `strict` — the flag whether a reference is resolved in the [strict mode](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/es5-chapter-2-strict-mode/).

只有两种情况下才会得到`Reference`类:

* 操作标识符
* 属性访问语法

> Value of `Reference` type can be *only in two cases*:
>
> 1. when we deal with an *identifier*;
> 2. or with a *property accessor*.

> **Identifiers** are handled by the process of *identifiers resolution* which is in detail considered in the [Chapter 4. Scope chain](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/chapter-4-scope-chain/). And here we just notice that **at return from this algorithm *always* there is a value of `Reference` type (it is important for `this` value).**
>
> Identifiers are variable names, function names, names of function arguments and names of unqualified properties of the global object.

> **Property accessors** are also know; there are two variations: the  *dot notation* (when the property name is correct identifier and is in advance known), or the *bracket notation*:

**确定this的取值的一般规则:**

* 如果()左边是一个`Reference`类的对象，this就是这个对象的base属性。
* 如果不是，this是null，但因为null无意义，会被转换为全局对象。

>  The general rule of determination of `this` value in a function context sounds as follows:
>
>  > The value of `this` in a function context is provided *by the caller and determined by the current form of a call expression* (how the function call is written syntactically).
>  >
>  > If on the left hand side from the call parentheses `( ... )`, there is a value of `Reference` type then `this` value is set to the *base object* of this value of `Reference` type.
>  >
>  > *In all other cases *(i.e. with *any other* value type which is distinct from the `Reference` type), `this` value is always set to `null`. But since there is no any sense in `null` for `this` value, it is *implicitly* converted to *global object*.
>
>  Now we can precisely tell, why the same function activated with *different forms of a call expression*, has also different `this` values — the answer is in different intermediate values of type `Reference`.

4. ()左边非Reference类时的this

> So, as we have noted, in case when on the left hand side of call parentheses there is a value *not* of `Reference` type but *any another* type, `this` value is automatically set to `null` and, as consequence, to the *global* object.
>
> Let’s consider examples of such expressions:
>
> ```javascript
> (function () {
>   console.log(this); // null => global
> })();
> ```
>
> In this case, we have *function* object but not object of `Reference` type (it is not the identifier and not the property accessor), accordingly `this` value finally is set to global object.
>
> More complex examples:
>
> ```javascript
> var foo = {
>   bar: function () {
>     console.log(this);
>   }
> };
>  
> foo.bar(); // Reference, OK => foo
> (foo.bar)(); // Reference, OK => foo
>  
> (foo.bar = foo.bar)(); // global?
> (false || foo.bar)(); // global?
> (foo.bar, foo.bar)(); // global?
> ```
>
> In the second case there is a *grouping operator* which *does not apply*, considered above, method of getting the real value of an object from value of `Reference` type, i.e. `GetValue` (see note of [11.1.6](http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.1.6)). Accordingly, at return from evaluation of the grouping operator — we still have a value of `Reference` type and that is why `this`value is again set to the base object, i.e. `foo`.
>
> 第二个调用中使用()操作符，这个操作符仍然返回操作符内运行的结果。因此仍然是一个Reference类。
>
> In the third case, *assignment operator*, unlike the grouping operator, *calls GetValue method* (see step 3 of [11.13.1](http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-11.13.1)). As a result at return there is already *function*object (but not a value of `Reference` type) which means that `this` value set to `null`and, as consequence, to *global*.

5. 左边是Reference类this却依然是null

> There is a case when call expression determines on the left hand side of call parentheses the value of `Reference` type, however `this` value is set to `null` and, as consequence, to *global*. It is related to the case when the base object of  `Reference` type value is the [activation object](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/chapter-2-variable-object/#variable-object-in-function-context).

即当  `Reference` 类对象的base是活动对象时。

> The exception can be with a function call inside the block of the `with` statement in case if *with* object contains a function name property. The `with` statement adds its object in front of [scope chain](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/chapter-4-scope-chain/#affecting-on-scope-chain-during-code-execution) i.e. *before* the activation object. Accordingly, having values of type `Reference` (by the identifier or a property accessor) we have base object not as an activation object but object of a `with` statement. 

with语句是一个另外。with会将参数对象放在活动对象之前，因此如果with对象有一个函数属性，在with内执行这个函数时，this是这个函数，见下例：

> ```javascript
> var x = 10;
>  
> with ({
>  
>   foo: function () {
>     console.log(this.x);
>   },
>   x: 20
>  
> }) {
>  
>   foo(); // 20
>  
> }
>  
> // because
>  
> var  fooReference = {
>   base: __withObject,
>   propertyName: 'foo'
> };
> ```

catch也是同样的情况。但是在es5中，catch内的this已经被强制改写为global.



#### 手动设置this

使用apply或call方法(以及bind方法)。



#### ES6
before es6
> One important note is that the this value is a property of the execution context, but not a property of the variable object. This feature is very important, because in contrast with variables, this value never participates in identifier resolution process. I.e. when accessing this in a code, its value is taken directly from the execution context and without any scope chain lookup. The value of this is determined only once, on entering the context.

在es6中`this`变成了词法环境的属性(也就是es3中活动对象的属性)，这时为了实现箭头函数中的词法`this`，即箭头函数中是从父环境中继承的。

> NOTE: In ES6 this actually became a property of a lexical environment, i.e. property of the variable object in ES3 terminology. This is done to support arrow functions, which have lexical this, which they inherit from parent contexts.

> The this keyword evaluates to the value of the ThisBinding of the current execution context.
