> This model may seem nice, but it does have some tradeoffs. If you know how server side rendering typically works in frameworks like React or Vue.js, what they do is a process called hydration. The way hydration works, is you server side render something, and then on the client you render it again, which means you have to load the code to render something that is already on the page, which is incredibly wasteful both in terms of loading the code and in terms of executing it. It is a bunch of wasted bandwidth, it is a bunch of wasted CPUâ€“but it is really nice, because you get to ignore on the client side that you server side rendered something. The method we use at Google is not like that. So, if you design this very large application, you have think about: Do I take that super fast method that is more complicated, or do I go with hydration which is less efficient, but such a nice programming model? You will have to make this decision.
